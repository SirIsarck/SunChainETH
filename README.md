# SunChain

Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Ethereum

Empowering Africa with Clean Energy through DePIN + DeFi


## Problem Statement

Millions of Africans still lack access to reliable, affordable electricity.
National grids are outdated, centralized, and often unavailable in rural areas.
Communities depend on diesel generators — costly, polluting, and unsustainable.


## Our Solution — SunChain

SunChain is a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that connects community-based solar energy hubs through Ethereum smart contracts.

It brings transparency, traceability, and financial inclusion into the renewable energy ecosystem — enabling individuals and investors to co-own and profit from clean energy infrastructure.


## Why Ethereum + DeFi

Security & Transparency: Ethereum’s mature ecosystem ensures verifiable smart contracts.

DeFi Integration: Allows energy payments, staking, and yield farming using $SUN token.

Liquidity Pools: Investors can provide liquidity to community solar pools and earn yield.

Scalability via Layer-2s: SunChain leverages Arbitrum or Base for low-cost, fast micro-transactions.


## How It Works

1. Community Solar Hubs: Local hubs generate clean energy via solar panels.


2. IoT Integration: Smart meters collect real-time energy data and send it on-chain.


3. Blockchain Settlement: Energy consumption and payments are recorded on Ethereum.


4. DeFi Layer: Users stake or pool tokens for community projects.


5. Revenue Sharing: Rewards are distributed automatically to hub operators, token holders, and investors.


## Impact

Expands renewable energy access in off-grid African regions.

Creates sustainable income for local operators.

Demonstrates how DePIN + DeFi can empower real-world infrastructure.

Bridges energy, finance, and technology into one transparent ecosystem.
